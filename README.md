10/07/2023
Brick Breaker with extra effects


## Implementation
-Particles and Animated Particles drawn by me
-Bricks are tweened in as they spawn
-Tweening of bricks on hit
-Ball size tweened with velocity
-Ball glows brighter with more speed
-Particles on bounce
-Screenshake pretty much any time the ball hits something
-Paddle is tweened backwards based off ball velocity when hit
-Bricks are tweened backwards when hit
-Bricks are tweened radially away based on velocity of ball when a brick is hit
-Bricks change faces when hit and when a brick near them is hit
-Bricks with a worried look return to normal after a few seconds
-Images and particles drawn by me in krita
-Sound effects from zapsplat and mixed by me in audacity
