# Juicy Brick Breaker

Brick Breaker with extra effects


## Implementation
Particles and Animated Particles drawn by me
Tweening of bricks on hit
Tweening of ball as it moves
Particles on bounce
Screenshake pretty much any time the ball hits something
Paddle is tweened backwards based off ball velocity when hit
Bricks are tweened backwards when hit
Bricks are tweened radially away based on velocity of ball when a brick is hit
Bricks change faces when hit and when a brick near them is hit
Bricks with a worried look return to normal after a few seconds
